A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is
a century that is not divisible by 400.

For example:
1956 is a leap year because 1956 is divisible by 4.

1957 is not a leap year, because it is not divisible by 4.

1900 is not a leap year, despite the fact that it is divisible by 4, 
because 1900 is a century and 1900 is not divisible by 400.

1600 is a leap year, because 1600 is divisible by 4 and 1600 
is divisible by 400

Write a function is_leap that takes a year as a parameter and
returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
